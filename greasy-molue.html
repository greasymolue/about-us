<h1>Greasy</h1>
<u1>
<li>Favorite foods: french fries, chicken wings and cheese curds</li>
<li>Back story: little brother had a friend who went by the greasy moolie, which became an inside joke. He did not know how to spell moolie, and instead wrote "greasy molue" when hacking our mother's cellphone welcome screen. When I created this account last year, I knew nobody else would have this alias. I also have the same alias on XDA-developers.</li>
